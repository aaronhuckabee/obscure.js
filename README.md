Obscure 

Obscure.js is a library designed to represent strings in css, such that it is very difficult to extract content without actually viewing in a browser.

Current Version: 0.1.0
Exists currently as a script in an index.html file.
Simply change the 'message' variable to the desired content and load.

Next Version: 0.2.0 TODOs

// Break out to multiple lines (use panelWidth variable);
// Build to output javascript
// Build in randomization for all variable names.
